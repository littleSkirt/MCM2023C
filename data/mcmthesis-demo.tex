At the start of 2022, images of green and yellow squares began cropping up on Twitter, when the pandemic spreading wide on earth with people quarantined at home. It a flash in the pan and quickly gets off-booming in June which provides a good sample for Dataminer to find the regular pattern for multitude and the sociology behind.

Our paper firstly proposes the regression process model with ARIMA principal to address the Variation of Number of  Reported Results through Twitter with Time Issue. 

For the sake of analysis, we takes into account the following attributes of words: Using Frequency Globally, Typical

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Applies widely}\\
This  system can be used for many types of airplanes, and it also
solves the interference during  the procedure of the boarding
airplane,as described above we can get to the  optimization
boarding time.We also know that all the service is automate.
\item \textbf{Improve the quality of the airport service}\\
Balancing the cost of the cost and the benefit, it will bring in
more convenient  for airport and passengers.It also saves many
human resources for the airline. \item \textbf{}

\section{First appendix}

In addition, your report must include a letter to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Goodgrant Foundation, Mr. Alpha Chiang, that describes the optimal investment strategy, your modeling approach and major results, and a brief discussion of your proposed concept of a return-on-investment (ROI). This letter should be no more than two pages in length.

\begin{letter}{Dear, Mr. Alpha Chiang}
